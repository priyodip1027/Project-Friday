# Project-Friday
A small demo project to make python assist you with voice assistant . Customize as you want.

Overview

This project is a voice-activated virtual assistant built in Python that listens to user commands and performs a variety of automated tasks such as opening websites, searching Google or YouTube, fetching Wikipedia summaries, and telling the current time — all using voice input.

It’s a lightweight, local assistant similar to Siri, Alexa, or Jarvis — but fully customizable and runs entirely on your system.

⚙️ Features

✅ Speech Recognition: Listens to voice commands using the microphone.
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Speaks back responses using pyttsx3.
✅ Wikipedia Search: Fetches concise summaries directly from Wikipedia.
✅ Web Automation: Opens YouTube, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and more.
✅ System Automation: Announces the current time and can launch local apps (like Spotify).
✅ Customizable: You can easily extend it to perform more tasks such as sending emails, playing songs, or system control.
